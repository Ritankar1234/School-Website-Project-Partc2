        <h2> This is what out reviews say; </h2>
        <p> 'There is a saying, that if you are from Kolkata, you have atleast one friend or family member who studies in South Point.
            It is one of the biggest schools in the country and ranks in the top 10 schools of India, consistently for over a decade now.
            The acadenic prowess of the students of this school is well known and they have made it to many top institutions across the world.
            There are two campuses of this school with a proposed new campus coming up. It has an option for dual board. It has both West Bengak board abd CBSE board. Till class 10 it has around 750 students per class and 500 students in 11-12.
            The fees is also quite nominal as compared to other big schools in the country.
            Back in 1980 it was featured in the Guiness Book of World records for having the largest number of students in the world. It has students ranking consistently in the top 10 of the board exams and state JEE.
            So if you want to make it big in life South Point is definitely the place to be.' 
         'Well currently I'm in grade 10 and now I'm not sure If I'll get the chance to study in the school further as there are many others who want to be there like me . Throughout the 13 years of my life in that school, I've cherished many moments ( not to mention I still get scolded as earlier but now but the amount has lessened) . The interesting thing about the teachers in this school are their peculiar characters ,I mean some are very affectionate and mild while some are strict and firm and some don't give a shit about anything. I particularly like Kathakali Ma'am (English) for her majestic grip on the subject and and the amazing way she teaches us , she's strict yet caring. I also like our chemistry teacher Surangana ma'am who teaches us with love and affection. Not all of the students are from the same economic background some are rich some are a little deprived yet we blend in very easily.' </p>
